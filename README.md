# Child-Mind-Institute-Problematic-Internet-Use
Overview
This project aims to predict the level of problematic internet use (PIU) among children and adolescents using physical activity and fitness data. The competition challenges participants to develop models capable of detecting early indicators of PIU to help trigger timely interventions promoting healthier digital habits.

Host: Child Mind Institute

Goal: Develop a predictive model to identify early signs of problematic internet use from children’s physical and fitness data.
Evaluation Metric: Quadratic Weighted Kappa (κ)
Dataset
The dataset is provided by the Child Mind Institute and includes demographic, health, and physical fitness data of children and adolescents.

Train Set: Contains labeled instances of PIU with features such as demographic information, fitness metrics, and health measures.
Test Set: Unlabeled data for which predictions of PIU need to be made.
Target Variable: sii (Level of problematic internet use)
